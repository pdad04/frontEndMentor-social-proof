## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Continued with using a mobile-first workflow. I had to look up some flexbox tips/tricks and still not feeling 100% comfortable with using flexbox, in terms of writing it in an optimized way, i.e I feel like I'm having to rely on media queries more than I should need to using flexbox.

### Continued development

I found a Youtube channel where the content creator specializes in CSS. I have been watching a lot of his videos and will continue to watch more to continue to improve on my CSS abilities.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) - Kevin's channel has helped me understand more about CSS responsive design as well as CSS best practices in general.
